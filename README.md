## What is this

This repo is all the notes that I took while learning Docker and Kubernetes. You can find a cheat sheet in Docker_basics.md file, along with the code on each directory.

For example, in ``01 - First test with Docker`` you will find the NodeJS code I dockerized, along with the Dockerfile I used to create the image.
